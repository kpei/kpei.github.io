                        You're probably here because you saw new changes on the osu!flex bot that I am slowly rolling in with new star ratings and PP rework values. Xexxar, the person responsible for the large PP rework in February, is now working again on the PP system introducing a set of sweeping changes to the PP and Star Rating system.  You can read the in depth technical details <a target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/13225">here</a>.  Here are some results that I found:
                    </p>
                    <div id="accordion">
                        <div class="mt-4 card">
                            <div class="card-header" id="headingZero">
                                <h5 class="mb-0">
                                    <button class="btn dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseZero" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseZero">
                                        You will probably lose PP
                                    </button>
                                </h5>
                            </div>
                            <div id="collapseZero" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingZero" data-parent="#accordion">
                                <div class="card-body">
                                    but that's okay because almost everyone (except aricin) else will probably lose PP as well.  The core purpose of this rework is to display more unique and interesting scores.  The HDDT farming meta has been around for a long time and now these changes will incentivize different playstyles and introduce new metas.

                                        <p>If you go to a concert and every band plays the exact same song, it doesn't matter how well they play, objectively "performance" would be quite boring. The same analogy applies for osu! No one wants to see the same 10 scores on every profile.</p>

                                    and the length bonus is removed from the PP calculations.  A map's star rating is weighted equally for it's entire length during calculations. The existing PP system takes a map for only it's hardest parts and adds them up with exponential decay (similar to how PP is calculated on your profile page). By the time you are past the 10 hardest parts, which sometimes only spans a hard jump section, the remaining beatmap only account for about ~35% of the PP.  Furthermore, Star Rating also now scales with length of the map linearly. If you were to copy and paste a map to double it's length, the aim and speed star rating would increase by 10% and 7.5% respectively.

While this isn't a perfect proxy for more "technical" maps, tournament maps are generally considered to be different due to the skillset required to play them are broader in stroke. Tournament maps generally had an increase in SR rather than decrease.  Here's a breakdown by mods in the pools:
